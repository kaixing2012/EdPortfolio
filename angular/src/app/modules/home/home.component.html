                        I'm <b>Edward Rogers</b> (殷浩哲), feel free to call me Ed!
                        I'm a software engineer and this website is to show what I've made
                        and therefore, make yourself at home! We are gonna have some fun! <br>
                        <br>
                        But the first thing is first! I was born and raised in Taiwan and and I studied my coding skill
                        when I was in Australia 2 years ago! So basically, I had my career complete change!
                        It was lucky that I found out what I want do and going to do. It's a cool thing ever! <br>
                        <br>
                        Okay, It's too wordy let's just get started!
