      So the kind tools above are what I mainly work with! I also have the basic
      knowledge of HTML and CSS that are how I build up this site lol~<br />
      <br />
      However, I assume you are more likely to be interested in some kind of
      real projects! I am aware of that and that is why I build this site up to
      demo something interesting! <br />
      <br />
      Aright, you'll find them up in other section! I'll see you there~
